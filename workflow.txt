1. We will build:

GET /books → get all books
GET /books/{id} → get one book
POST /books → add a book
PUT /books/{id} → update a book
DELETE /books/{id} → delete a book


2. Write the Books API code
3. Connect the router in main.py
4. Run the server -> uvicorn main:app --reload


5. Update models (add validation + remove manual id)
    Validates:

        title ≥ 3 chars

        author ≥ 2 chars

        price > 0

        no id needed from user (we generate it)

6. Auto-Generate IDs
7. Modify your POST route: Users don’t send IDs, IDs increase automatically.
8. Search + Filtering 
    /books/search?title=python
    /books/search?author=James
    /books/search?min_price=10&max_price=30

9. Sorting 
    /books/sort?by=price&order=asc
    /books/sort?by=title&order=desc

10. Pagination
    /books/page?page=1&limit=3
    /books/page?page=2&limit=3

11. File Storage (persistent books.json). Modify POST, PUT, DELETE to call save_books()
